Shareable with your family.</h2></div><div class="section section-up section-vision" id="vision"><div class="content-width-limit"><h1>The joy of building</h1><p>There is nothing like putting together a massive Lego. Unfortunately, as you get older, the sets available from Lego are a little less amazing then they used to be. They have made some attempts, such as the collectors editions, but nothing to really draw in adults. And we missed all of that fun. So, we are partnering with some of the best builders we can find (hopefully some of those amazing builders on Mocpages) and provide biannual (or possibly more if we have high demand) high complexity custom sets for purchase.</p></div></div><div class="section section-inverted section-how-works" id="how-works"><div class="content-width-limit"><h1>How it works</h1><ol><li>Poll</li><li>Order</li><li>Build</li></ol></div></div><div class="section section-up section-about" id="about"><div class="content-width-limit"><h1>About Us</h1><p>I am just a avid (bad) Lego builder who misses building Lego sets on Christmas and my birthday, every time. Legos prepared me for being a Computer Science and Applied Math student. When I was younger, I would build with Legos incessantly. I was talking to some of my friends who also built legos, and they never did really stop building. Only, they felt like it wasn't as challenging and fun anymore. I want to change that. Busy young professionals don't have nearly the time they used to, but legos offer a nice, happy, nostalgic escape.</p></div></div><div class="section section-inverted section-sign-up" id="sign-up"><div class="content-width-limit"><h1>If you are interested, we will be in touch!</h1><div class="contact-form"><form class="form-inline"><input type="text" placeholder="Your Email" class="form-control"><input type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"></form></div></div></div><script>!function(e,t,a,n,c,o){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=n,e[n]||(e[n]=function(){(e[n].q=e[n].q||[]).push(arguments)}),e[n].l=+new Date,c=t.createElement(a),o=t.getElementsByTagName(a)[0],c.src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js",o.parentNode.insertBefore(c,o)}(window,document,"script","ga"),ga("create","UA-XXXXX-X"),ga("send","pageview")</script><script src="scripts/vendor.js"></script><script src="scripts/plugins.js"></script><script src="scripts/main.js"></script></body></html>
